Summaries of National Snow and Ice Data Center sea ice concentration data from the area of the Bering Sea delineated by Petersen and Douglas (2004) as the winter range for spectacled eiders. Subsequent telemetry data from spectacled eiders shows a variable pattern of space use during winter, but consistent use of the area south of St. Lawrence Island. The Petersen and Douglas winter range (16 pixels) and core use area (4 pixels; greater than average observed location density) are used to index ice conditions across the broader wintering range of the species (see: Flint et al. 2016, Christie et al. 2018, Dunham et al. 2021).



Program R scripts under the "code" directory download and process NSIDC sea ice concentration (sic) data. Specifically, data are Bootstrap Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS V004 (version 4 released May 2024).
